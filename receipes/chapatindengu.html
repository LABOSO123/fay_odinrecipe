        <li>In a separate pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic. Saut√© until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, bell pepper, and carrot to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper, then add the cooked lentils. Add enough water to achieve your desired stew consistency.</li>
        <li>Simmer the Ndengu stew for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve the Ndengu stew with freshly cooked Chapati on the side.</li>
