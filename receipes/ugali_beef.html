        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>1 pound of beef stew meat, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup of green peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Gradually add the maize meal, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pot. This is your Ugali; remove it from the heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the cubed beef and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onions and garlic. Saut√© until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Return the browned beef to the pot and add the chopped tomatoes, bell pepper, and carrot. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir in the paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper, then add enough water to cover the ingredients. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the stew thickens.</li>
        <li>While the beef stew is simmering, form the Ugali into balls or serve it in slices.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef stew alongside the Ugali, with a side of green peas.</li>
    </ol>
